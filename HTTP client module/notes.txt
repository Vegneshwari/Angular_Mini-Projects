HTTP client module
------------------

To communicate with back-end server

{
    HttpClientModule is the Angular module you import once to enable HTTP communication.
    while HttpClient is the service you inject into components or services to actually make HTTP requests
}

set up the environment to work on the HTTP Client module
--------------------------------------------------------

older version, 

1. include "HttpClientModule" as an argument in the providers in the "config.ts" file. Use "importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule)" like below
|
|
|
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes), 
    importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule)
  ]
};

or the new version is, 

1. import "provideHttpClient()" to the providers in the config.ts file



2. import "httpclient" in the component you want to use in and initialize in the constructor




{

we give service as an argument in the providers, it accepted, but here in the HttpClientModule, it has to be given like "importProvidersFrom(HttpClientModule). 
Because service is like a class that can be imported in the providers directly and use it, Angular will accept it. 
But, HttpClientModule is not a service, but an "NgModule" that contains providers for internal services like _httpclient, httpclient, httphandler.....

}

~import "FormsModule" to use form



`Observable - (“A stream of data you can subscribe to and react when the data arrives”)
-----------

An Observable is a feature provided by RxJS that allows you to handle asynchronous operations — like API calls, event handling.......

In Angular services, Observable is commonly used to,

1. Fetch data from APIs using HttpClient

2. Share or broadcast data between components

3. React to user or system events asynchronously




params: {
  action: 'query',
  format: 'json',
  list: 'search',
  utf8: '1',
  srsearch: term,
  origin: '*'
}

1. action: 'query'
  Tells the Wikipedia API what kind of action to perform.

  query is used to retrieve data (like searching articles or reading content).

2. format: 'json'
  Specifies the response format.
     
  You're telling the API: "Send the result back in JSON format" (which Angular can easily parse).

3. list: 'search'
  You're asking for a search result list.

  This tells the API you want a list of articles that match the search term.

4. utf8: '1'
   Ensures that the search string is interpreted as UTF-8.

  It supports special characters, accents, and different languages correctly.

5. srsearch: term
 term is the actual search keyword entered by the user.

  srsearch means “Search Request Search term.”

6. origin: '*'
  This is required to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in browsers.








  Common Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript/Angular:
HTTP requests (e.g., using HttpClient.get())

setTimeout / setInterval

Promises and Observables

File reading

Database calls

User events (clicks, keypresses) in some cases
